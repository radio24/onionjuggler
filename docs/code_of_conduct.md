# Code of Conduct

## Standards

* The code applies to everyone, indistictively of hierarchy (user, contributor, collaborator, maintainer).
* The universal language is English, use it. If there is a lack of understanding using the aforementioned language, ask if it is possible to be helped in another language.
* Stay on topic. Narrow it down to the core of the issue been dealt with for faster resolution of the matter.
* If a request is not approved, don't take it personal.
* Criticize code, not people.
* Constructive criticism always. Explain what is wrong and what could have been done better if applied to the case.
* Satire/Irony/Sarcasm mode are enabled, have some sense of humour, altough it is forbidden the use of derrogatory/insulting/personal attacks and intimidation/threats, such as doxing private information of someonelse's identity or attempting to do so by any means and claim it was "just a joke".
* Humans evolved to use the brain further than their animal instincts of fighting for food, water and copulation, so harassing the offender as it was done to you also makes you an offender.
