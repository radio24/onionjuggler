.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]onionjuggler-tui\f[R] is a part of OnionJuggler, a combination of
POSIX compliant scripts helps the interaction with onion service
configuration and files to speed up usage and avoid misconfiguration.
The \f[I]onionjuggler-tui\f[R] wraps the \f[I]onionjuggler-cli\f[R] into

.SH OPTIONS
.TP

Print version information.
.TP

.SH FILES
.TP
\f[B]/etc/onionjuggler/dialogrc\f[R]
Default dialog run commands file.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\f[B]SUDO_EDITOR\f[R], \f[B]DOAS_EDITOR\f[R], \f[B]VISUAL\f[R], \f[B]EDITOR\f[R]
Use environment variables in the above order to define the editor, in
case any are empty, fallback to the next.
If every variable is empty, fallback to Vi(1).
.TP
\f[B]ONIONJUGGLER_SKIP_PRE_TOR_CHECK\f[R]
If set to 1, skip pre run tor check to allow the script to start running
if the tor is failing to parse its configuration.
Note it does not disable the last tor check to apply configuration
changes, that is, if the configuration is still invalid, nothing will be
changed.
This option is useful if you are certain the configuration check will be
fixed by the command.
As the scripts requires root and you are probably calling the script
from an unpriviliged user, preserve the variable value through
environment changes by assigning it after the command to run the
onionjuggler script as another user and before the script name:

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo ONIONJUGGLER_SKIP_PRE_TOR_CHECK=1 onionjuggler-tui
