onionjuggler.conf - Configuration file for OnionJuggler
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]onionjuggler\f[R] environment is easily customizable to any
Unix-like operating system due to be written in POSIX compliant
Shellscript and every tor directory can be chosen via variables.
.PP
The default configuration file
\f[I]/etc/onionjuggler/onionjuggler.conf\f[R] is replaced on every
upgrade, so changes to this file are not persisted.
Because of this, it is advised not to edit this file.
This is the first configuration to file to be read and has the lowest
priority.
.PP
Files in \f[I]/etc/onionjuggler/conf.d/*.conf\f[R] are reserved to
packages that want to customize onionjuggler without overwriting the
main configuration file to avoid conflicts.
Users should avoid customizing files in this directory because it may
conflict or take lower precedence that files shipped by a package.
.PP
The file \f[I]/usr/local/etc/onionjuggler/onionjuggler.conf\f[R] and
files in \f[I]/usr/local/etc/onionjuggler/conf.d/*.conf\f[R] are
reserved exclusively to the local administrator.
Any other entity must not write files to this directory.
These are the last files to be read and have the highest priority.
.PP
It is recommended to prefix all filenames in the \f[I]conf.d\f[R]
directory with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify ordering of
the files and overrided default files with user defined setting using a
higher prefix number compared to the one shipped by the system.
.PP
Variables set to and empty string, either \f[I]var=\f[R] or
\f[I]var=\[dq]\[dq]\f[R], will run with default values, that may not be
suitable for every system, so enforce the desired values by assigning
every configuration option.
.PP
Before running any script for the first time after changing a
configuration option, it is recommended to run the onionjuggler script
with the option \f[I]--getconf\f[R], as it will print what the
onionjuggler program read as options.
